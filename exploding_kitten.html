                <p>Exploding Kittens is cardgame in which players draw cards until someone draws an Exploding Kitten and are out of the game unless they have a defuse. This game is a lot like russian roulette but except the lethal part.</p>

                    <li>Or you can just play no cards</li>
                    <li>End your turn by drawing a card from the top of the Draw Pile into your hand and hoping it's not an Expolding Kitten.</li>

                    <li>Play continues clockwise around the table.</li>
                    <li id="exploding">Eventually every player will expolde expect for one, who wins the game!</li>
